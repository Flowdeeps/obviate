# Obviate v1.0

Everybody loves seeing a pulsing circle move around the page to important information right? Sure.

## Installation

$npm install

$bower install

$grunt build

$grunt watch

I use python's SimpleHTTPServer for most front-end
projects which you can use by navigating to the folder
holding your index and typing:

$python -m SimpleHTTPServer

## TODO

Things I'd like to see are:

* Fade in, fade out per use
* Keyboard control
* Iterate through strings handed to the script
* Control over the order of objects which the cursor moves to
* Moving the transform to either the head or back into the CSS to keep it all much tidier and mysterious
* Multi-coloured and multiple cursors
* Left, right, centre, middle, and bottom position on element
* Different shaped cursors
* Orientation based on proximity of window chrome

## Probably won't do

* Captions. Out of scope for a simple single use script
